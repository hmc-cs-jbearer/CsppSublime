# CsppSublime
Sublime Text support for [CSound++](https://github.com/hmc-cs-jbearer/CSoundPlusPlus).

## Usage

Download the source files and save them in Packages/User.

Once a CSound++ is ready for release, I will set this up as a Package Control plugin, so that you
don't have to install manually.

## Features

* Syntax highlighting
* More to come in the future
